#  Kinase Chatbot - BioGPT-Powered Biomedical Assistant

A domain-specific chatbot designed to assist researchers and students in querying kinase-related biological information. This project fine-tunes BioGPT using structured biomedical datasets (PubMed, UniProt) and deploys a lightweight NLP-powered assistant capable of handling real-world biomedical QA.

##  Features

- Fine-tuned [BioGPT](https://github.com/microsoft/BioGPT) for kinase-related question answering
- Processes structured and unstructured biomedical data
- Real-time chatbot interface for interactive Q&A
- Preprocessing pipelines for PubMed abstracts and UniProt protein data
- Deployable with minimal setup (Google Colab/Local)
